# Datos

Datos is a simple project to code up my own versions of the most common *Data Structures*. It is purely for academic purposes and is not intended for production code.

The sample code is for C# and uses NUnit for Testing.

#### Linked List

Simple implementation of a linked list but I also store a reference to the first and last nodes in the list:

 - Add
 - Contains
 - First
 - Last
 - Remove
